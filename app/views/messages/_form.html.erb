	  <h4>Email Spoofing?</h4>
	  <br />
	  <p>Email spoofing is when the email pretends to come from one place when it didn't. In other words, I can send you an email and it will appear in your email client as though
	  it were from obama@whitehouse.gov rather than from me</p>
	  <p>This is useful if you want to make it appear your email came from somewhere other than this website, for example your personal account. Initially I was considering
      making this a paid option, or only allow spoofing of addresses that have been verified. But its also a key tactic for phishers and spammers and any suspicion of
	  being open those with malicious intent and this site will be shut down <strong>very</strong> fast</p> 
	  <p>But I think its a neat feature. Consider your opinions solicited </p>
